<center><h1>Shaniwarwada</h1></center>
Shaniwarwada (ISO: Śanivāravāḍā) is a historical fortification in the city of Pune in Maharashtra, India. Built in 1732,[1] it was the seat of the Peshwas of the Maratha Empire until 1818, when the Peshwas lost control to the British East India Company after the Third Anglo-Maratha War. Following the rise of the Maratha Empire, the palace became the center of Indian politics in the 18th century.[2]
The fort itself was largely destroyed in 1828 by an unexplained fire, but the surviving structures are now maintained as a tourist site.

<h2>History</h2>
The Shaniwarwada was originally the seven-storey capital building of the Peshwas of the Maratha Empire. It was supposed to be made entirely of stone but after the completion of the base floor or the first storey, the people of Satara (the national capital) complained to the Shahu(King) saying that a stone monument can be sanctioned and built only by the Shahu(King) himself and not the Peshwas. Following this, an official letter was written to the Peshwas stating that the remaining building had to be made of brick and not stone. Even today if you visit and see the walls carefully, they are partly made of stone and partly by bricks. The Wada was then completed and upon being attacked by the British Artillery 90 years later, all the top six stories collapsed leaving only the stone base, which was immune to the British artillery. Hence only the stone base of the Shaniwar Wada remains and can be seen even today in the older parts of Pune.
By 1758, at least a thousand people lived in the fort.
In 1773, Narayanrao, who was the fifth and ruling Peshwa then, was murdered by guards on orders of his uncle Raghunathrao and aunt Anandibai. A popular legend has it that Narayanrao's ghost still calls for help on full moon nights. Various people, working around the area, have allegedly reported the cries [3][4] of "Kaka mala vachava"(Uncle, save me) by Narayanrao Peshwa after his death.
In June 1818, the Peshwa, Bajirao II, abdicated his Gaadi (throne) to Sir John Malcolm of the British East India Company and went into political exile at Bithoor, near Kanpur in present-day Uttar Pradesh, India.
On 27 February 1828, a great fire started inside the palace complex. The conflagration raged for seven days. Only the heavy granite ramparts, strong teak gateways and deep foundations and ruins of the buildings within the fort survived.[5]
According to Haricharitramrutsagar, a biographical text of Bhagwan Swaminarayan, he had visited Shaniwarwada on the insistence of Bajirao II in 1799.
<br><br><h2>Lesser Known Facts about Shaniwar Wada</h2>
The name Shaniwar Wada is derived from two Marathi words – Shaniwar meaning Saturday and Wada meaning a residential complex.
The palace was constructed at a cost of 16,110 rupees, which was a princely sum in those days.
If locals are to be believed, Peshwa Narayan Rao’s wails saying ‘kaka mala wachawa (uncle save me)’ can be heard even today on full moon nights.
The palace was featured in one of the episodes of The Amazing Race Asia 3, a television reality show.
It was also featured in the 2015 Bollywood blockbuster Bajirao Mastani.
The main gate of the palace is so big that elephants can easily pass through it. However, to prevent the enemies from using elephants to charge the gate, sharp steel spikes were attached to each pane of the gate at an approximate height of an adult elephant’s forehead.
